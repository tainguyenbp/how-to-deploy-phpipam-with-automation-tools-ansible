phpIPAM API documentation v 1.16
================================

phpIPAM provides API server for providing data to clients. It is a webapp and can be called
via HTTP requests by providing appropriate GET parameters that define controller, actions and
additional parameters required for each controller, such as id, name, etc.

Response is in JSON format with success true or false and provided error message or object.

You can find examples of client API calls in folder api/_examples/.

Since version 1.16 API has 3 different security models:
	* Crypt
	* SSL
	* None

If security type is crypt client based request values can be encrypted with app_id and app_code.
You first have to enable API module in phpipam administration and create an app_id and app_code,
that will be used for external app with appropriate permissions. ApiCaller in included in
_examples directory of phpipam.

For SSL and none security models crypting is not used, only app_id is required to match app and
permissions for it.

For security set to none all information will be sent via clear text, use with caution in internal
network, use of no security is HIGHLY discouraged, but might be needed in some cases.


API documentation and references are available on phpipam API website (http://phpipam.net/api/);
